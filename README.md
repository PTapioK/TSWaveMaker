# TSWaveMaker
A great trigger, team, script and taskforce editor for C&amp;C Tiberian Sun.

## What it is?
TSWaveMaker was created to advance producing of Tiberian Sun maps that are called as 'wave comp stomps'.
The difference between FinalSun's integrated script editors and TSWaveMaker is huge. FinalSun's trigger, team, script 
and taskforce editors are meant for creating single functionalities for Tiberian Sun maps as simply as possible
while TSWaveMaker is meant for creating series of actions with less clicks.
